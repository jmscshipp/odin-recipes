        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Apple pie is a classic American dessert featuring sweet, cinnamon-spiced apples baked in a flaky, buttery crust. This timeless recipe creates a golden, perfectly balanced pie that's ideal for any occasion or simply enjoyed with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.</p>
    
         <h4>Ingrediants</h4>
         <p>For the crust</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pre-made pie crusts (or homemade if preferred)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the filling</p>
        <ul>
            <li>6-7 medium apples (Granny Smith or Honeycrisp work well), peeled and sliced</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Toss until the apples are evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Place one pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish, pressing it gently into the bottom and sides.</li>
            <li>Pour the apple mixture into the crust, spreading it evenly. Dot the top with small pieces of butter.</li>
            <li>Cover with the second pie crust. Trim any excess dough, then crimp the edges to seal. Cut 4-5 small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
            <li>Brush the top crust with the beaten egg for a golden finish.</li>
            <li>Bake for 45-50 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. If the edges brown too quickly, cover them with foil.</li>
            <li>Let the pie cool for at least 2 hours before slicing to allow the filling to set. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
        </ol>
