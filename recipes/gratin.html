        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Potato gratin (or gratin dauphinois) is a classic French comfort dish featuring thinly sliced potatoes baked in cream with garlic and cheese. The result is tender, creamy layers with a golden, crispy top that makes an elegant side dish for any meal.</p>
    
         <h4>Ingrediants</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs potatoes (Yukon Gold or Russet), thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups shredded Gruyère cheese (or Swiss cheese)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter (for greasing the dish)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg (optional)</li>
            <li>Fresh thyme (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish generously.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the heavy cream, milk, garlic, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Heat until it just begins to simmer, then remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Arrange a layer of sliced potatoes in the bottom of the baking dish, slightly overlapping them. Sprinkle with a handful of Gruyère cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layering process with remaining potatoes and cheese, creating 3-4 layers total. Reserve some cheese for the top.</li>
            <li>Pour the warm cream mixture evenly over the potatoes, ensuring it seeps between the layers. Press down gently with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the remaining Gruyère and all of the Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Cover the dish with foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 20-25 minutes until the top is golden brown and bubbly, and the potatoes are tender when pierced with a knife.</li>
            <li>Let the gratin rest for 10 minutes before serving to allow it to set. Garnish with fresh thyme if desired.</li>
        </ol>
